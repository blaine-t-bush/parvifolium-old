Written entirely in JavaScript, which is a departure from my usual MO of using PHP for the back-end, like I did in [Folia](https://parvifolium.net/posts/folia) (and on this website). The front-end is React and the back-end is a GraphQL server, kept alive with [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2).
